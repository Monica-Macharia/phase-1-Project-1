# phase-1 Project 1
Author Name: Nyaguthii Macharia

## Description of the project.
This is a phase-1 project that brings together three pillar of software development to create a simple and fun application.

## Project Instructions.
// Your app must be a HTML/CSS and Javascript frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

// Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

// Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

// Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

// Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

## Goals of the project.
// Access data from a public API using GET request and use it to update the DOM.

// Listen for user events and update the DOM accordingly.

// Enable users' interactivity within the application.

// Use DRY code.

// Link HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Introduction
// Today I will build an app that displays different Anime's GiFs and respective names.

// I will use a public API https://nekos.best/api/v2/hug?amount=7 to build the frontend of the app.

## EndPoints.
I will use an endpoint with 7 GiFs and names as values.

## Delivarables
// Only use one page HTML.(no redirects)

// use three event listeners (click, submit, & mouseover) 

// Add an interactive element (like button & form)

// Use DRY code.

## User Story
// The application is a guess-Anime-name game. The user first interaction with the application will be a list of several anime GIFs. The user will guess the Anime's name and click the GIF to enlarge and see the Anime's name. 

// The user gets an opportunity to like the Anime by clicking the heart icon. A mouseover event that highlights the icon, will work as a reminder.

// Finally, after going through available GIFs, the user will be able to add Anime GIFs to the collection through a form.

// The user will receive an appreciative alert message after adding a GIF to the collection.
