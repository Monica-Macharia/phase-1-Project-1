Description of the project.
This is a project that brings together three pillar of software development to create a guessing game from a collection of Animes. The collection of animes is sourced from https://nekos.best/api/v2/hug?amount=7 API. First interaction with the application is a list of several anime GIFs. You can guess the Anime's name and click the GIF to enlarge and see the Anime's name. You can like the Anime by clicking the heart icon. A mouseover event that highlights the icon, will work as a reminder. You can add Anime GIFs to the collection through the form at te bottom of the page.

NB: Submitted GIFs will be lost after reload.
